<h1> THE AMERICAN DREAM</h1>
<p> <div class="sew"><img src="img/saw.png"></div>
	 Kamau   was born in a small village in Kirinyaga called Kiriani .Both his parent were tailors and at a tender age of 10 years he used to help out at his parent’s tailor shop called Wa kamau’s Tailor shop Kamau always thought the name was a little wanting like if it was up to him maybe would have come up with 100 other suitable names that would be catchy and intentional. </p>
<p>On one particular evening Kamau absentmindedly went about his routines at the tailor shop. Fantasizing about owning a fashion house, imagining how the clients would leave with contented smiles on their faces, it was his mother whom after taking a client’s order asked to speak to Kamau.</p>
<p>It was the pain and concern in her voice that broke Kamau’s heart as she tried to explained why Kamau should seek and want more from life than to be a tailor, she explained that they had decided that he should no longer help them at the shop because he should focus more on his studies in order to pursue law or medicine.
</p>
<p>
After high school Kamau relocated to the USA, ready to live the American dream that he’d heard people speak about so many times. He was conflicted on whether to make his parents happy or follow his heart, he chose the latter. He took fashion classes at a local community college and after a few months he landed his first paying job at   Darbie Doll Company, designing clothes for Darbie dolls .When he had saved up money he left Darbie and enrolled in the school of his dreams Hause College of Art and Design.
</p> 
<p><div class="sewed"><img src="img/button_318p.png"></div>Kamau’s   initiative, his great eye for design and passion got noticed by the dean who made it possible for Kamau to land a job with Harto Couture the biggest fashion house in the USA.
</p>
<p>For him this was just the beginning of his long journey in design, After 10 years of working as the head designer for Harto Couture Kamau left to start his own fashion house. He sold his House, Car and all his equity in order to have capital to finance his dream.
</p>
<p>The biggest question now was: “Would he make it to the top where he felt he belong? or would he end up like his poor parents?”
