<h1>HONEYMOON GONE SOUR </h1>
<p> <div class="wed"><img src="img/baak.jpg"></div>
	 Dave paced back and forth holding on to the ring a little too tight. He had bought for Lizzie after they got back together for the third time. He just coouldn't bare the thought of losing her to another man hence the big decision to ask her to marry him.They had agreed to meet at the parliament steps take a walk and then later go for dinner at the Grand Paris el Cafe where he had made reservation. </p>

	 <p>Dave glanced at his watch then towards Dedan Kimathi  street and that was when he saw her.She looked as lovely as  she always did with her kinky hair neatly done into a nice Afro. As Lizzie got close to him she smiled and apologized for being late.She explained that something had come up at work just as she was about to leave and it was impossible for her to call him to let him know she would be running late.</p>


	 <p>After taking a walk they went straight to Grand Paris el Cafe and ordered their meals as the ate quietly  their eyes not wanting to leave the other if you happened to be anywhere near the table you could feel the energy radiating between the lovely couple.
	 Dave got on his knees and proposed to Lizzie whose eyes were now watery from the the love and joy she felt in that moment. She slowly picked him and accepted the ring.</p>

	 <p> she had been wondering when he would pop the question and if should be ready to accept his proposal.After the weeding Dave's Dad had promised him a trip to Brazil for his honeymoon with his wife.
	 Lizzie was so exicited when they arrived in Brazil and took a cab to the cottage  they had rented on AirBnB.
	 On their way to the cottage they had to make a stop at the convinient store where they picked the things they need for their vacation, Lizzie excused herself to go to the bathroom and that was when she met strange girl with a black eye.She seemed to be asking Lizzie for help.</p>

	<p>  Outside  Dave was standing by the cab waiting on Lizzie when a fat bearded  bicker walked towards him and started hurling insults at him,Dave explained that he didn't want any trouble.Lizzie came back  got in the cab and the driver sped off.
	The cottage was so beautiful as soon as the got off the cab they took a shower and laid down for a nap that was when they heard aloud bang at the front door then smoke followed and the footsteps.
	Dave and Lizzie were hiding in the bathroom when they heard the man call out for them, the voice sounded familiar that was when Dave knew the bicker had followed them to the cottage.

	What did he want? How were they going to ask for help?, those were the questions running in Dave's mind.

	Will they overcome this together?.
