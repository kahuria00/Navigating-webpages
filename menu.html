<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Noah">About Author</a>

The book details Trevor Noah growing up in post-apartheid South Africa. As the light-skinned son of a white father and a black mother, Noah was classified as a "coloured" in the apartheid system of racial classification. Noah stated that even under apartheid he felt trouble fitting in, because it was a crime "for [him] to be born as a mixed-race baby", hence the title of his book.
