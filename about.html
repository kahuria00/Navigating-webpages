<h1> ROLE AND TREATMENT OF WOMEN IN PRESENT LIFE</h1>

	<h2>POLITICAL </h2>
<p>Women are becoming more active in politics. I.e. they areparticipating in the voting and election processes, they are taking active role in legislative processes to change laws, for example see. .<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/7/from-where-i-stand-mehrezia-maiza-labidi">Women’s rights activist Mehrezia Maïza Labidi</a>

In contrast to Home going women where women did not take active roles to empower other women, Women in present life are mentoring and educating other women so as to empower them.

 <h2>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES </h2>

<P> <div class="pict"><img src="img/we.jpg"></div>
In the book Home Going were not allowed to take up other careers except housekeeping. In the present days women are defying odd working in fields like engineering, medicine, technology and making impressive change in society.</P>


<h2>GENDER INEQUALITIES AND STEREOTYPES</h2>
	<p>

			<div class="pict"><img src="img/gender.jpg"></div>Although as a society we are not where we used to be in the past, some gender biases and stereotypes still haunt the modern women. For example:-
		<ul>

			<li>Women are often expected to be accommodating and emotional.</li>
			<li>some people expect that women will take care of the children, cook, and clean the home, while men take care of finances, work on the car, and do the home repairs.</li>
			<li>Women are expected to be graceful, while men are expected to be tall and muscular.</li> 
			<li>Men and women are also expected to dress and groom in ways that are stereotypical to their gender (men wearing pants and short hairstyles, women wearing dresses and make-up.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		
<h2>SLAVERY </h2>
<p>Although slavery is not openly practiced nowadays it still exists, over the years it evolved into modern slavery. Modern Slavery include  the crimes of human trafficking, slavery and slavery like practices such as servitude, forced labor, forced marriage, the sale and exploitation of children, and debt bondage. For example: 71% of overall victims of modern slavery – nearly 30 million – are estimated to be women and girls. In some forms, such as forced sexual exploitation, they account for as many as 99% victims, some as young as five years old.
</p> 
<p>But only 63,000 victims of slavery were reported to the authorities between 2012 and 2014 – that’s roughly less than 2%.It is well publicized that women face additional risks in slavery situations, from sexual violence from their traffickers, having to bear children from rape by their masters in traditional slavery in countries like Mauritania, to extreme isolation for migrant women working as domestic workers in private homes, to girls forced to marry at a young age and living under complete control of their older husbands and in-laws.see<a href="https://www.antislavery.org/future-women-freedom"> Antislavery - future women freedom </a>
