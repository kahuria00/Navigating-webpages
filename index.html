<h2>SLAVERY </h2>
<p> <div class="pict"><img src="img/roots.jpg"></div>

The slaves are kept in dungeons underneath the cape castle, awaiting transit. Among them are ex-house servants, prisoners of tribal and regional wars and unlucky captives sold to the Europeans for money and goods, such as 15-year-old Esi , Esi was seized during a raid on her own village and brought to the castle by “bomboys”, local boys who worked for the British transporting cargo. After Esi is enslaved, she and the other women are inhumanely chained, stacked together and on top of each other, and locked up in the dungeons.

<h2>INEQUALITIES AND GENDER STEREOTYPES</h2>
<p><div class="pict"<img src="img/roleh.png"></div>
The oppression of women is based on sexist assumptions of their weakness. Thus controlled by men and often sexually violated.  Women are starved, abused, and have their babies taken away.   Women are largely responsible for watching over the children and cooking and not politics. Women are told to stay out of affairs of men for example when Effia asked Fifi what they were doing for chief Abeeku, Fifi told her to stay  off the affairs of men.
